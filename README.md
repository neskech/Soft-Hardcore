# Soft-Hardcore

A Minecraft mod that provides a hybrid between soft mode and hardcore mode — players have a limited number of lives which can be configured. Once a player runs out of lives, consequences occur (e.g. permanent death, respawn ban, or spectator).  

| Feature | Description |
|---|---|
| **Limited lives** | Each player has a configurable number of lives. |
| **Temporary mode** | Lives reset or carry over depending on server settings. |
| **Flexible consequences** | Configure what happens when lives run out (ban, spectator mode, etc.). |
| **Team support** | Optionally share or distribute lives across teams. |
| **Commands / Permissions** | Admin commands to adjust lives, check counts, etc. |
| **Compatibility** | Works as a Forge / Fabric / mod loader plugin (depending on implementation). |
