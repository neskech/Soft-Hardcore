# Soft-Hardcore

A Minecraft mod that provides a hybrid between soft mode and hardcore mode — players have a limited number of lives which can be configured. Once a player runs out of lives, consequences occur (e.g. permanent death, respawn ban, or spectator). The mod provides some minor UI reworks, health and armor information now appear on top of nameplates and the number of lives reminaing on a player while checking the scoreboard, compatable with teams, alongside a couple of other enhancements. We were inspired by TubboSMP and their hardcore system. 

This mod is supposed to be used in a Multiplayer setting. 

| Feature | Description |
|---|---|
| **Limited lives** | Each player has a configurable number of lives. |
| **Temporary mode** | Lives reset or carry over depending on server settings. |
| **Flexible consequences** | Configure what happens when lives run out (ban, spectator mode, etc.). |
| **Compatibility** | Works as a Forge / Fabric / mod loader plugin (depending on implementation). |
